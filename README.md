## Features

[//]: # (Add the features of your project here:)

- **socket** — a module that allows low-level networking , providing access to the BSD socket interface;
- **select** —  a module that allows I/O multiplexing;
- **subprocess** — a module that allows you to spawn new processes, connect to their input/output/error pipes, and obtain their return codes;
- **threading** — a module that allows thread-based parallelism.

## Requirements

## Folder Structure

## Structure (folders and files)

The root directory:
  - output &#8594; contains output files generated by simulate.py and plots.py.
      - csv files &#8594; contains resulting csv files;
          - company &#8594; contains company's states history and employee's (as a group) states history;
          - employees &#8594; contains individual employee's states history for each employee.
      - figures  &#8594; contains resulting plots.
          - company &#8594; contains plots of the company's states history combined with employee's (as a group) states history;
          - employees &#8594; contains plots of employee's states history for each employee.

## Getting Started

* to run the simulation, save csv and png files, and plot results:

```bash
   python main.py
```
