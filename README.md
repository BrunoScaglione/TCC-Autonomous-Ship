## Structure (folders and files)

The root directory:
  - main.py &#8594; runs the simulation based on input options and saves results as csv files and png images;
  - plots.py &#8594; uses csv files to create plots and save as png images based on input options;
  - simulation &#8594; contains files regarding the algorithm;
      - options;
          - init.py &#8594; loads options from excel.
      - modules &#8594; contains files of entities of the simulation.
          - company.py &#8594; class Company;
          - employee.py &#8594; class Employee.
      - simulate.py &#8594; runs the simulation based on input options;
  - utils &#8594; contains complementary files
      - clean.py &#8594; deletes all files and folders generated in output;
      - dummy_goals.txt &#8594; example of in-simulation input of goals with weights that can be copy pasted.
  - input &#8594; contains input file, which is an excel with multiple sheets;
      - Demo options.xlsx &#8594; excel file with parameters to be edited.
  - output &#8594; contains output files generated by simulate.py and plots.py.
      - csv files &#8594; contains resulting csv files;
          - company &#8594; contains company's states history and employee's (as a group) states history;
          - employees &#8594; contains individual employee's states history for each employee.
      - figures  &#8594; contains resulting plots.
          - company &#8594; contains plots of the company's states history combined with employee's (as a group) states history;
          - employees &#8594; contains plots of employee's states history for each employee.
