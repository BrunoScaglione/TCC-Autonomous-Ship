ros2 node list
ros2 topic list -t

ros2 topic list -t will return the same list of topics, 
this time with the topic type appended in brackets

ros2 service list -t
ros2 action list

----------------

ros2 run <package_name> <executable_name>

Remapping allows you to reassign default node properties, 
like node name, topic names, service names, etc., to custom values.

Now, lets reassign the name of our /turtlesim node

ros2 run turtlesim turtlesim_node --ros-args --remap __node:=my_turtle

----------------

ros2 node info <node_name>

ros2 node info returns a list of subscribers, publishers, services, 
and actions (the ROS graph connections) that interact with that node

-----------

names of nodes not necessarily = name of executable_name

ros2 run turtlesim turtle_teleop_key
Recall from the previous tutorial that the names of these nodes are 
/turtlesim and /teleop_turtle by default.

-------------

rqt 

ou can also open rqt_graph by opening rqt 
and selecting Plugins > Introspection > Node Graph.

rqt_graph


---------------

To see the data being published on a topic, use:

ros2 topic echo <topic_name>

/_ros2cli_26646 is the node created by the echo we just ran (the number might be different). 
Now you can see that the publisher is 
publishing data over the cmd_vel topic, and two subscribers are subscribed


ros2 topic info /turtle1/cmd_vel
Which will return:

Type: geometry_msgs/msg/Twist
Publisher count: 1
Subscription count: 2
