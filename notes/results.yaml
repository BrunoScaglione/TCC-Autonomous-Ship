# Do 3 runs for each case that will be in the report
# example:

# - case 1:  
#   - meta: 
#     - date: 18/11
#   - conditions:
#     - no waves p3d
#     - linear waypoints
#     - initial u = 1 m/s and the rest is 0
#     - gps_imu_simul deactivated
#   - results:
#     - mean error: 
#       - run 1: 12.4
#       - run 2: ...


- case 1:  
  - meta: 
    - date: 22/11
  - conditions:
    - p3d with waves (have to change main p3d and changes.txt to document change)
    - linear waypoints (already is default)
    - initial u = 1 m/s and the rest is 0
    - gps_imu_simul deactivated (have to change lines in gps_imu_simul and wave_filter)
    - Radius of acceptance = 50 (have to change line in los_guidance)
  - results:
    - mean error: 
      - run 1: ...
      - run 2: ...
      - run 3: ...
    - max error:
      - run 1: ...
      - run 2: ...
      - run 3: ...

- case 2:  
  - meta: 
    - date: 22/11
  - conditions:
    - p3d with waves (have to change main p3d and changes.txt to document change)
    - linear waypoints (already is default)
    - initial u = 1 m/s and the rest is 0
    - gps_imu_simul activated (have to change lines in gps_imu_simul and wave_filter)
    - Radius of acceptance = 50 (have to change line in los_guidance)
  - results:
    - mean error: 
      - run 1: ...

- case 3:  
  - meta: 
    - date: 22/11
  - conditions:
    - p3d with waves (have to change main p3d and changes.txt to document change)
    - zigzag waypoints (have to chnaged POST request payload. The payload is in helpers directory)
    - initial u = 1 m/s and the rest is 0
    - gps_imu_simul activated (have to change lines in gps_imu_simul and wave_filter)
    - Radius of acceptance = *SHIP_LENGHT (have to change line in los_guidance)
  - results:
    - mean error: 
      - run 1: ...
      - run 2: ...
      - run 3: ...
    - max error:
      - run 1: ...
      - run 2: ...
      - run 3: ...

...other cases *that work* (That follows path. To follow desired velocities is
very hard, and only works well in case 1, which was the case used to tune controllers)
